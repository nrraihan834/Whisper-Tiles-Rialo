Whisper Tiles — Rialo Game

Whisper Tiles is a simple but challenging memory puzzle game where players must find the hidden Rialo logo on the grid.
The game is built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no frameworks or libraries required.

🕹️ How to Play

Press the Start button to begin the game.

A grid (initially 3×3) will appear on the screen.

One tile will glow briefly — this is the target tile.

Your job is to memorize the tile’s position.

After the brief reveal, all tiles will turn black (hidden).

Click the tile where the logo appeared:

✅ Correct tile → the Rialo logo is revealed, green glow, you level up

❌ Wrong tile → red ❌ signal shows, and the game ends

📈 Level System

Each level increases the length or complexity of the reveal sequence.

Every 3 levels, the grid size grows larger:

3×3 → 4×4 → 5×5 → … up to 7×7

Correct answers increase your level and streak count.

Wrong answers reset your streak and end the current run.
